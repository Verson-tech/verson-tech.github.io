    Creating a personal GitHub webpage (repository in the Cloud), as a new
    programmer:</p>
    <p>1. Login to GitHub and create a fun username. </p> 
    <p> 2. Go to your profile, find "Repositories", click on "New" and name your
      repository yourusername.github.io. </p>
    <p> 3. Get started by uploading an existing
      file and a profile picture, which were previously created and opened by <br>
      you using Visual Studio Code, e.g.: index.html file   Profile picture  
      Open any picture you like with VS Code<br> and link it to your index.html </p>
    <p> 4.
      Find the location of these two files on your machine, drag and drop them
      to the space you are creating  and hit<br> the button "Commit changes".   </p>
    <p>5.
      Open a new window in a browser and type the name of the repository you
      have created earlier<br>
       (e.g. yourusername.github.io). 
    <p>6. Congratulations!!!
      You have your personal GitHub webpage!!!</p>    And here is mine   
      verson-tech.github.io  </p>
