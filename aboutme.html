    <h4>BIO: Hello, my name is Vira Murray. <br>
       I am currently a student enrolled in the MIT Full Stack Development MERN Course. I am completely new to this field <br>
        as I was formerly a flight attendant. I have reached a stage in my life whereby I desire something new and challenging<br>
        —to include the ability to work remotely. My husband is an executive in the Tech Industry and he encouraged me to take this particular course.<br> 

      WORK & SKILLS: As previously stated, I was a flight attendant with the #1 Airline in the World—Qatar Airways. It was very rewarding <br>
      and challenging in some not-so-obvious ways in that I had to nearly always think on my feet to meet the requests of some rather demanding <br>
      clientele—but also in some obvious ways in that oftentimes there did not always exist a single correct answer. As a manager, I learned to manage<br>
       diverse teams which changed near daily due to flight rotations. All of what I have mentioned is synonymous with work on corporate technical teams,<br>
        which is why I feel, after learning all of what the course  has to offer, I am the right type of person to be a successful Full Stack Developer.                </h4>
